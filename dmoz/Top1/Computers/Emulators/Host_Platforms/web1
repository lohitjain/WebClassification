          video games from the '70s and '80s. The ROM images that MAME utilizes 
          are &quot;dumped&quot; from arcade games' original circuit-board ROM 
          chips. MAME becomes the &quot;hardware&quot; for the games, taking the 
          place of their original CPUs and support chips. Therefore, these games 
          are NOT simulations, but the actual, original games that appeared in 
          arcades. MAME's purpose is to preserve these early decades of video-game 
          history. As gaming technology continues to rush forward, MAME prevents 
          these important &quot;vintage&quot; games from being lost and forgotten.        </p>      </td>
